Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . statement
    (1) statement -> . select_statement
    (2) select_statement -> . SELECT FROM

    SELECT          shift and go to state 3

    statement                      shift and go to state 1
    select_statement               shift and go to state 2

state 1

    (0) S' -> statement .



state 2

    (1) statement -> select_statement .

    $end            reduce using rule 1 (statement -> select_statement .)


state 3

    (2) select_statement -> SELECT . FROM

    FROM            shift and go to state 4


state 4

    (2) select_statement -> SELECT FROM .

    $end            reduce using rule 2 (select_statement -> SELECT FROM .)
